## Eight-Week Project Timeline (Starting 15 Aug 2025)

| Week | Dates (2025) | Focus Area | Tasks & Sub-Tasks |
|------|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| 1 | Aug 15 – Aug 21 | Foundational Learning | • Survey Go networking courses, playlists, and blog tutorials.<br>• Reproduce TCP echo client/server examples and document behaviours.<br>• Deep dive into goroutines, channels, and wait groups with mini labs.<br>• Investigate TCP keep-alive settings and capture findings in notes.<br>• Write learning summary and identify open questions for later phases. |
| 2 | Aug 22 – Aug 28 | Transport Prototyping | • Scaffold minimal Go module, project structure, and Makefile.<br>• Implement baseline TCP listener/accept loop with logging.<br>• Prototype message framing approaches (delimiter vs length-prefix).<br>• Record latency/throughput observations from local benchmarks.<br>• Update daily progress log with lessons learned. |
| 3 | Aug 29 – Sep 4 | Networking Hardening | • Add handshake negotiation and connection validation flow.<br>• Implement decoder abstraction plus `RPC` struct for typed messages.<br>• Build unit tests covering handshake failure scenarios.<br>• Integrate structured logging and connection lifecycle metrics.<br>• Review networking risks and mitigation plan with study notes. |
| 4 | Sep 5 – Sep 11 | Architecture Drafting | • Draft architecture document covering components and data flow.<br>• Design CAS directory scheme and hashing utilities.<br>• Evaluate replication strategies; confirm full replication decision.<br>• Define bootstrap discovery model and peer lifecycle diagrams.<br>• Outline CLI command set, user stories, and UX expectations. |
| 5 | Sep 12 – Sep 18 | Storage Layer Implementation | • Implement streaming CAS `Write`, `Read`, `Delete`, `Has` methods.<br>• Create SHA-256 hashing helpers and path transform functions.<br>• Write unit tests validating deduplication and path mapping.<br>• Integrate storage module with file server skeleton.<br>• Document storage API and error handling strategy. |1
| 6 | Sep 19 – Sep 25 | Network–Storage Integration | • Wire network message handlers to storage operations.<br>• Build peer registry with bootstrap join flow and peer list exchange.<br>• Implement broadcast logic for store/get/delete operations.<br>• Run multi-peer simulations (3-node local cluster) and log outcomes.<br>• Track integration issues in a remediation checklist. |
| 7 | Sep 26 – Oct 2 | Security & CLI | • Implement AES-256 encryption/decryption pipeline and key management.<br>• Extend file server to encrypt before replication and decrypt on retrieval.<br>• Build CLI commands (`serve`, `store`, `get`, `delete`, `files list`, `demo`) using Cobra.<br>• Add command help text, flag validation, and error messaging.<br>• Conduct usability walkthroughs and gather feedback notes. |
| 8 | Oct 3 – Oct 9 | Testing & Refinement | • Execute scripted multi-node integration tests covering store/get/delete flows.<br>• Test peer churn scenarios by cycling nodes on/offline.<br>• Profile replication performance and identify bottlenecks.<br>• Polish logging, configuration defaults, and user documentation.<br>• Assemble demo assets, screenshots, and reflective report outlines. |
