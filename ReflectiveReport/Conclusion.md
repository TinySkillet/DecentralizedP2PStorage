## Conclusion

This project succeeded in delivering a functional decentralized storage system that met its core objectives while serving as a valuable learning experience in distributed systems engineering. The final artefact demonstrates that building a peer-to-peer storage solution from scratch is not only feasible but also deeply educational when approached with a focus on understanding fundamentals rather than matching production-scale systems.

The journey from initial proposal to working implementation reinforced the importance of pragmatic decision-making in software engineering. The pivot from file chunking to full replication exemplifies how constraints—in this case, small network size and educational goals—can guide design choices that prioritise reliability and simplicity over theoretical optimality. This experience taught me that the best solution is not always the most sophisticated one, but rather the one that best serves the project's context and constraints.

Building the system from first principles, particularly the custom TCP transport layer, provided insights that would have been impossible to gain by simply using existing libraries. Wrestling with message framing, peer discovery, and connection lifecycle management gave me a concrete understanding of how distributed systems operate at the network level. Similarly, implementing content-addressable storage and encryption from scratch deepened my appreciation for how these concepts work in practice, not just in theory.

The project also highlighted the value of iterative development and empirical validation. Starting with a minimal transport and gradually adding layers—storage, encryption, and user interface—allowed me to validate each component before introducing complexity. This approach caught issues early and made the codebase more maintainable than a big-bang implementation would have been.

While the system is functional and demonstrates the core concepts, it remains a foundation rather than a production-ready solution. The limitations identified in the Room for Improvement section—such as the need for compression, better user interfaces, and more robust peer discovery—represent natural next steps rather than failures. These gaps reflect the scope of an educational project focused on core mechanisms rather than polish and optimization.

Most importantly, this project achieved its primary educational objective: extending my technical abilities beyond the university curriculum. I entered with theoretical knowledge of distributed systems, networking, and cryptography, and emerged with hands-on experience implementing these concepts in a cohesive system. The challenges encountered—from debugging message framing issues to understanding the trade-offs in replication strategies—were exactly the kind of practical problems that deepen understanding.

In retrospect, the project's value lies not in competing with established platforms like IPFS or Storj, but in demonstrating how to reconstruct their fundamental ideas in a simpler, targeted context. The resulting system shows that a ground-up implementation can serve specific needs—in this case, small, privacy-conscious groups—while providing the transparency and control that motivated the work. This journey from theory to practice, from proposal to working code, represents the core achievement of the project and sets a foundation for future exploration in distributed systems.
