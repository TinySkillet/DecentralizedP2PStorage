# Daily Progress - August 07, 2025

## Project: Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Storage System

### Overview

Today's progress involves a refinement of the `TCPTransport` struct, simplifying its responsibilities. Additionally, a daily progress report for the previous day was added.

### Key Changes

- **Simplified `TCPTransport`:** The `TCPTransport` struct in `p2p/tcp_transport.go` has been simplified by removing the `peers` map and its associated mutex (`mu`). This suggests a shift in how peer connections are managed, possibly moving this responsibility to a different component to better adhere to the single-responsibility principle.

- **Added Progress Report:** The daily progress report for July 31st, 2025, was added to the `daily_progress` folder.

### Core Components Update

#### 1. `p2p/tcp_transport.go`

- **Removed Peer Management:** The `peers` map and `mu` (mutex) have been removed from the `TCPTransport` struct. This simplifies the transport layer's role to primarily handling connection listening and acceptance.

### Summary of Progress

The main focus of today's changes was on refactoring and simplification. By removing peer management from the `TCPTransport`, the component is now more focused on its core transport-layer responsibilities. This is a good architectural improvement that will make the system easier to maintain and extend.
