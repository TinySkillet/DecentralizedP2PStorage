# Progress Report - 2025-08-09

## Summary

Today's progress focused on enhancing the peer-to-peer communication layer. The key improvements include the introduction of a message channel to receive data from connected peers, the ability to handle peer connections and disconnections gracefully, and the addition of a testing framework to ensure the reliability of the transport layer.

## Detailed Changes

### Communication and Message Handling

- **Message Channel:** A new channel, `rpcChan`, has been added to the `TCPTransport`. This channel allows the application to consume incoming messages from peers in a concurrent manner. A goroutine has been added in `main.go` to continuously read from this channel and log the received messages.
- **RPC Struct:** A new `RPC` struct was introduced in `p2p/message.go`. This struct standardizes the format of messages exchanged between peers, containing the sender's network address (`From`) and the message payload (`Payload`).
- **Decoding:** The `Decoder` interface in `p2p/encoding.go` has been updated to decode directly into the `RPC` struct. The `GOBDecoder` has been replaced with a `DefaultDecoder` that reads raw bytes from the connection.

### Peer Management

- **OnPeer Callback:** A new `OnPeer` callback function has been added to `TCPTransportOpts`. This allows the application to define custom logic to be executed when a new peer connects. In `main.go`, this is used to log the new peer and immediately close the connection for testing purposes.
- **Peer Interface:** The `Peer` interface in `p2p/transport.go` now includes a `Close()` method, allowing for explicit connection termination. The `TCPPeer` struct implements this method.
- **Connection Handling:** The `handleConn` function in `p2p/tcp_transport.go` has been improved to handle peer disconnections more robustly. It now detects when a peer closes the connection (`io.EOF`) and logs a disconnection message.

### Testing

- **Testify Dependency:** The `testify` testing framework has been added to the project's dependencies in `go.mod` and `go.sum`.
- **TCPTransport Test:** A new test file, `p2p/tcp_transport_test.go`, has been created to test the functionality of the `TCPTransport`. This initial test verifies that the transport can be created and can listen for connections without errors.

### Build System

- **Makefile:** The `makefile` has been updated to include a `DEFAULT_TARGET` of `build` and to ensure that the `run` target depends on the `build` target, ensuring the binary is always up-to-date when running.
