## Project: Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Storage System

### Overview

This project aims to build a decentralized peer-to-peer storage system in Go. The initial commit sets up the basic structure for network communication using a TCP transport layer.

### Modules and Dependencies

The project is using Go modules for dependency management. The `go.mod` file defines the main module and its dependencies:

- **Module:** `github.com/TinySkillet/DecentralizedP2PStorage`
- **Go Version:** `1.24.5`
- **Dependencies:**
  - `github.com/stretchr/testify v1.10.0`: A popular assertion library for Go tests.

### Core Components

#### 1. `main.go`

The entry point of the application. It initializes a `TCPTransport` on port `:3000` and starts listening for incoming connections. The `select {}` statement at the end keeps the main goroutine running indefinitely.

#### 2. `p2p/transport.go`

This file defines the core interfaces for the peer-to-peer communication:

- **`Peer`:** An interface representing a remote node in the network.
- **`Transport`:** An interface for handling communication between nodes, with a `ListenAndAccept()` method to start listening for connections.

#### 3. `p2p/tcp_transport.go`

This file contains the implementation of the `Transport` interface using TCP.

- **`TCPPeer`:** A struct representing a peer connected via TCP. It holds the underlying `net.Conn` and a boolean `outbound` to indicate if the connection was initiated by us or a remote peer.
- **`TCPTransport`:** The main struct that manages the TCP listener and the connected peers.
  - `NewTCPTransport(listenAddr string)`: Creates a new `TCPTransport`.
  - `ListenAndAccept()`: Starts a TCP listener on the specified address and begins an accept loop in a new goroutine.
  - `startAcceptLoop()`: Continuously accepts new connections and handles them in separate goroutines.
  - `handleConn(conn net.Conn)`: Wraps a new connection in a `TCPPeer` struct and logs the new connection.

#### 4. `p2p/tcp_transport_test.go`

A simple test for the `TCPTransport` to ensure that it can be initialized and started without errors. It uses the `testify/assert` package to make assertions.

### Build and Test

The `makefile` provides convenient commands for building and testing the project:

- **`make build`**: Compiles the project and creates an executable at `bin/p2p`.
- **`make run`**: Builds and runs the application.
- **`make test`**: Runs the tests for the project.

### Summary of Progress

The initial structure of the peer-to-peer storage system is in place. A TCP transport layer has been implemented to handle network connections between peers. The project is well-structured with clear separation of concerns (interfaces, implementation, and main application logic). The use of a `makefile` simplifies the build and test process.
