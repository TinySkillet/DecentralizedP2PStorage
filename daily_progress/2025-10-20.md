## Project: Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Storage System

### Overview

Today's progress marks a significant enhancement of the storage module, introducing key features for content-addressable storage (CAS). The focus has been on providing robust read, delete, and verification functionalities, which are essential for managing data in a distributed environment. The path transformation logic has also been improved to ensure a more organized and efficient storage structure.

### Key Changes

- **Enhanced Storage Module:** The `Store` component has been substantially upgraded with new methods to support essential storage operations:
  - **`Read(key)`:** Retrieves data for a given key, enabling peers to access stored content.
  - **`Delete(key)`:** Removes data associated with a key, allowing for content removal and storage management.
  - **`Has(key)`:** Checks for the existence of a key, providing a quick way to verify if content is available without retrieving the entire data.

- **Improved Path Transformation:** The logic for transforming keys into storage paths has been refined. This ensures that data is stored in a structured and predictable manner, which is crucial for efficient retrieval and management in a CAS system.

- **Comprehensive Testing:** The test suite for the storage module has been updated to cover the new `Read`, `Delete`, and `Has` functionalities. This ensures that the storage layer is reliable and behaves as expected.

- **Initial CAS Folder Setup:** A dedicated folder structure for the Content-Addressable Storage (CAS) system has been established. This provides a clear and organized foundation for storing data based on its content hash.

- **Message Handling with Channels:** A channel has been introduced to receive incoming messages, improving the concurrency and responsiveness of the peer-to-peer communication layer.

### Core Components Update

#### 1. `storage.go`

- **`Read(key)`:** Implements the logic to read data from the storage based on a given key.
- **`Delete(key)`:** Provides the functionality to remove data from the storage.
- **`Has(key)`:** Implements a mechanism to check if a key exists in the storage.
- **Path Transformation:** The internal logic for converting keys into file paths has been improved for better organization.

#### 2. `storage_test.go`

- The test suite has been expanded to include test cases for the new `Read`, `Delete`, and `Has` methods, ensuring their correctness and reliability.

### Summary of Progress

The storage module has been significantly improved with the addition of fundamental CAS functionalities. The new `Read`, `Delete`, and `Has` methods provide a solid foundation for building a robust and efficient decentralized storage system. The improved path transformation and updated tests further enhance the reliability and maintainability of the codebase. The introduction of a message-receiving channel also marks a step forward in improving the real-time communication capabilities of the system.
