## Project: Decentralized Peer-to-Peer Storage System

### Overview

Today's progress focuses on enhancing the TCP transport layer to support handshakes and message decoding. This is a significant step towards enabling meaningful communication between peers in the network. The project's structure has been refactored for better modularity and configurability.

### Key Changes

- **Refactored TCP Transport:** The `TCPTransport` is now initialized with a `TCPTransportOpts` struct, allowing for greater flexibility. This new options struct includes parameters for the listen address, a handshake function, and a message decoder.

- **Handshake Implementation:** A `HandshakeFunc` has been introduced in the new `p2p/handshake.go` file. This function will be responsible for handling the initial handshake between peers, a critical step for establishing secure and authenticated connections. A no-op handshake function (`NOPHandshakeFunc`) has been implemented as a placeholder.

- **Message Encoding/Decoding:** A new `p2p/encoding.go` file has been added to handle the serialization and deserialization of network messages. It defines a `Decoder` interface and a `GOBDecoder` implementation, which will be used to decode incoming data from peers.

- **Connection Handling:** The `handleConn` function in `p2p/tcp_transport.go` has been updated to first perform the handshake. After a successful handshake, it enters a loop to continuously decode messages from the peer.

- **Dependency Management:** The `testify` dependency and the `vendor` directory have been removed from the project, indicating a shift in the testing strategy, possibly towards using the standard library's testing capabilities.

### Core Components Update

#### 1. `main.go`

- The initialization of `TCPTransport` now uses `TCPTransportOpts`, providing a `NOPHandshakeFunc` for the handshake process.

#### 2. `p2p/tcp_transport.go`

- **`TCPTransportOpts`:** A new struct to hold configuration for the `TCPTransport`.
- **`NewTCPTransport`:** Now accepts `TCPTransportOpts` for a more configurable setup.
- **`handleConn`:** Now includes logic for:
  - Performing a handshake with the remote peer.
  - A continuous loop for decoding messages using the provided `Decoder`.

#### 3. `p2p/handshake.go` (New File)

- Defines the `HandshakeFunc` type for peer handshakes.
- Includes a `NOPHandshakeFunc` as a default, no-op implementation.

#### 4. `p2p/encoding.go` (New File)

- Defines a `Decoder` interface for abstracting message decoding.
- Implements a `GOBDecoder` for decoding GOB-encoded data streams.

### Build and Test

- The `p2p/tcp_transport_test.go` file has been removed. New tests will be needed to cover the updated functionality, including the handshake and message decoding logic.

### Summary of Progress

The project has made a significant leap forward by laying the groundwork for structured communication between peers. The introduction of a handshake mechanism and a message decoding loop are fundamental for building a robust P2P network. The refactoring of the `TCPTransport` makes the system more modular and easier to extend in the future.
